# Blogs-Website

This repository contains the code for my personal blog website, built to practice HTML and CSS. The blog showcases my skills in creating responsive layouts, structured content, and clean design. It features a variety of posts on technology, coding, and lifestyle, offering a space to explore and refine web development techniques. This project serves as a foundation to improve my front-end development and create an engaging user experience.
